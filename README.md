# CryptoClustering

## Introduction 
This project involved dealing with crypto to see the patterns using machine learning. It used K-means algorithims and PCA analysis. 

## Steps of the challenge 
1. Data Preperation 
2. K-Means clustering of the original data 
3. K-Means clustering with PCA 
4. Comparing K-Means of original data and PCA 
5. Answering questions. 
    - best k value was 4 
    - Total variance of PCA was 89.5% 
    - best k value using PCA was 4 
    - Did K differ between original and PCA?: No 
    - Impact of using K-Means: There was some difference such as the PCA capturing more complex patterns 
## Sources 
I used the module assignment and the practice examples from unsupervised and supervised learning lessons.
